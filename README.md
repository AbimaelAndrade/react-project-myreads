# MyReads Project

This is the final project of the **React Fundamentals** module of the [Udacty React Developer course](https://br.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).
The MyBooks project organizes on a shelf all the books separating by status: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read** and **Read**.
The project is divided into two parts, the first has the shelf with books separated by status and with a control where you can change the status of the book. In the second part you can look for a book and add it on your shelf.
